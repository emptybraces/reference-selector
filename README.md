# Introduction
---
This asset is designed to reduce the drag-and-drop actions required for setting reference fields.
It provides two main features:

## 1. Reference Field Assignment Feature
---
You can open a context menu on almost any reference field and quickly assign a reference object from the selection history.
The context menu includes the following options:

- **SelectionHistory**: Select and assign any object from the list.
- **Find Recently Selected**: Assign the most recently selected object.
- **Last Selected**: Assign the last assigned object.
- **Find in Hierarchy Tree**: Select and assign an object from parent-child relationships.

## 2. Selection History Feature
---
This feature keeps a history of selected objects, allowing you to access them via a dropdown list or shortcut keys.
You can use the custom menu at the top of the Inspector window or the following shortcuts:

- **Number 3 key**: Select the previous object from the selection history.
- **Number 4 key**: Select the next object from the selection history.

(You can change these shortcuts anytime in the Edit/Shortcuts settings.)
