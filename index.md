# Introduction
---
This asset is designed to reduce the drag-and-drop actions required for setting reference fields.<br>
It provides two main features:

## 1. Reference Field Assignment Feature
---
You can open a context menu on almost any reference field to quickly assign a reference from your selection history.<br>
The context menu includes the following options:

- ***Selection History***: Select and assign any object from the selection history list.
- ***Recently Selected***: Assign the most recently selected object that matches the target type.
- ***Last Selected***: Assign the last object previously assigned via Reference Selector.
- ***Get Component***: Assign a reference by executing GetComponent-based methods.
- ***Near Siblings***: Assign an object from the previous or next sibling in the same hierarchy level.
- ***Hierarchy Tree***: Select and assign an object from parent–child relationships in the hierarchy.

## 2. Selection History Feature
---
Keeps a history of selected objects and provides quick access buttons at the top of the Inspector.<br>
You can rapidly navigate and select objects from the history using a dropdown list or shortcut keys.

- ***Shift + Mouse Wheel Down***: Select the previous object in the history.
- ***Shift + Mouse Wheel Up***: Select the next object in the history.

(You can change these shortcuts anytime in the Edit/Shortcuts settings.)
