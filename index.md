## Introduction

This asset is designed to reduce the drag-and-drop actions required for setting reference fields.
It provides two main features:

---
## 1. Reference Field Assignment Feature
You can open a context menu on almost any reference field and quickly assign a reference object from the selection history.
The context menu includes the following options:

- SelectionHistory: Select and assign any object from the list.
- Find Recently Selected: Assign the most recently selected object.
- Last Selected: Assign the last assigned object.
- Find in Hierarchy Tree: Select and assign an object from parent-child relationships.

## 2. Selection History Feature
This feature keeps a history of selected objects, allowing you to access them via a dropdown list or shortcut keys.
You can use the custom menu at the top of the Inspector window or the following shortcuts:

- Tab: Select the previous object from the selection history.
- Shift + Tab: Select the next object from the selection history.

(You can change these shortcuts anytime in the Edit/Shortcuts settings.)
